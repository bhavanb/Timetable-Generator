# Timetable Generator
A Java program to generate time tables. Made for a school project
## Using the generator:
In order to use the timetable generator, first the inputs must be provided in the `inputs.csv` file. A sample has been provided. Run `classTimeTable.java` to generate the timetables.
## Output:
The generated timetable(s) will be written to individual .csv files in the `out/` directory. Timings for break, lunch etc. are not currently customizable. This may be added in the future.

## Working:
The working of this project has been documented thoroughly with inline and Javadoc comments along with the code.
